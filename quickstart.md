KYCnow enables you to automatically pull all KYC-relevant data / documents and makes them accessible to you via an interface or a web application. The data and documents are processed and evaluated by KYCnow in order to provide a recommendation on the money laundering risk of your (potential) customer.

KYCnow receives the data / documents via interfaces to Schufa, country-specific trade registers, the
Transparency Register and Dun&Bradstreet for companies with international branches. The data and documents are stored in KYCnow and can be viewed at any given time. In order to include a new company in the process, onboarding is available, which can be carried out by both you and your end customer.

## Add a case

![leftbar_add](/assets/quickstart/leftbar_add.png)

In order to start a new KYC-Process you must first add a case.
By entering your customers name into the search bar, you can choose the correct customer from the results listed below

![add_1:2](/assets/quickstart/add_1:2.png)

When you have found your customer, you can create a new record by klicking “Add”. From then on you will find the company under ”New Records”.

Per company one single record can be created. Once a company is already on record either under "New records" or under "Closed records", it is not possible to create an additional new record.

If at first attempt you can't find the company please use the advanced search as described below.

Should you have more specific information on the company you can enter the information into the „Advanced Search“ in order to find the company faster.

Possible Information is:

- Company Name
- Owner
- Industry sector code
- Street / Zip code / City
- Trade register number
- LEI-Number

## Research

![leftbar_ordered](assets/quickstart/leftbar_ordered.png)

Should the company you're looking for not be found, you have the possibility to request a manual research for the company in question.
In order to do so, please click on "Start research". This Button appears at the bottom of the screen once you have started at least one advanced search.

To request a manual research all requested fields must be filled out. If possible please add proof of existence, e.g. a trade license in form of a PDF.

The manual processing of an inquiry takes a few workdays. It typically is processed much faster if you add proof of existence in form of a PDF.
Once you have requested a manual research, the company is listed in the "Ordered records"-tab for the duration of the research.

As soon as the manual research is completed you will receive a notice via Mail and the company will then be listed under "New records"
